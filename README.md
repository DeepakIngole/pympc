# pympc

pympc is a pyhton toolbox for Model Predictive Control (MPC) of linear and hybrid systems.

This toolbox implements several algorithms for:
- polyhedral computations,
- computation of maximum constraint-admissible invariant sets,
- MPC of linear systems,
- explicit MPC of linear systems,
- MPC for hybrid systems in piecewise-affine form.

# Examples

The example folder contains some introductory Jupyter notebooks.
